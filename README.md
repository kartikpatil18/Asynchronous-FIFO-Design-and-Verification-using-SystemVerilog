# Asynchronous-FIFO-Design-and-Verification-using-SystemVerilog
Implemented an asynchronous FIFO with independent read/write clocks and verified it using a modular SystemVerilog testbench with generator, driver, monitor, and scoreboard. Tested full, empty, overflow, underflow, and continuous operations, with assertions and functional coverage ensuring protocol compliance.
